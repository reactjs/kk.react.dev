            <description><![CDATA[We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as soon as their design is close to final, before they're released in a stable version--similar to how Meta has long used bleeding-edge versions of React internally. We are introducing a new officially supported [Canary release channel](/community/versioning-policy#canary-channel). It lets curated setups like frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[React 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we’ve learned is that it’s frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we’re exploring.]]></description>
